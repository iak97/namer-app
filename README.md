# namer_app

This is my first Flutter application. It will generate random word-pairs like "rawtune", "freescore", "lightstream". The user will get the next name if he clicks the next button, make the current one as favorite, and get the list of favorited names on a separate page.

Why I built this app?

To learn the basics of how flutter works and creating layouts in flutter.
